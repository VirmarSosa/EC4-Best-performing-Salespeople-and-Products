You work for AdventureWorks, a company that sells outdoor sporting equipment. The company has many different locations and has been recording the sales of different locations on various products. You, their new data scientist, have been tasked with the question: *What are our best products and salespeople, and how can we use this information to improve our overall performance?*

You have been given access to the relevant data files with documentation from the IT department. Your job is to extract meaningful insights from these data files to help increase sales. First, you will look at the best products and try to see how different products perform in different categories. Second, you will analyze the best salespeople to see if the commission percentage motivates them to sell more.
